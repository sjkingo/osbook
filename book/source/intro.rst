Introduction
============

This book has been written to be a practical guide on developing operating
systems, and specifially, for Intel's x86-architecture. It assumes you already
have a working knowledge of the internals of an operating system and will
attempt to guide you along to implement that knowledge into a small bootable
kernel.

Some theory will be presented where appropriate and in topics that are of
particular interest to the author.
